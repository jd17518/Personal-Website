Each section should start with a heading that names it. For example, section 1 could be "Bio" and section 2 could be "Hobbies".

Separate each section with a horizontal rule.

Section 1

A picture of yourself along with a brief bio that includes your first name and desired profession. 

 

Section 2

Beneath that, you will list three hobbies. For each hobby, you will include a relevant picture, and a brief blurb about the hobby. 

 

Section 3

Then, you will list three of your favorite brands. For each brand, you will again include a relevant picture, and a brief blurb about the brand. Additionally, you will turn the pictures into a link to that brand's webpage. 

 

Section 4

Finally, you will list your three favorite foods. Again, you will include a picture for each one, but then you will provide a link to a recipe beneath each picture. Please make the link out of a subheading. Which one you use is up to you, just don't use h1. 

For content's sake, beneath the link include a short blurb about the best X you have had.

For example, I might say that one of my favorites is cheeseburgers, and the best one I ever had was made at a bar/restauraunt/motel in the middle of nowhere, Nevada, in a "town" with a population of 10, run by a one armed dude with British style teeth after riding my motorcycle through a sandstorm. (True story)

 

Styling

Once you have created the content of your webpage, it is time to make it look good. I want you to choose a different overall style for each section (4 sections, 4 styles) for each one, the goal is to make the section stand out from the others. This can be done using colors, fonts, image sizing, text positioning, etc. Get creative! 

 

You will submit this assignment by pasting the link to your page in the Website URL box.
