Styling

Once you have created the content of your webpage, it is time to make it look good. I want you to choose a different overall style for each section (4 sections, 4 styles) for each one, the goal is to make the section stand out from the others. This can be done using colors, fonts, image sizing, text positioning, etc. Get creative! 

 

You will submit this assignment by pasting the link to your page in the Website URL box.
